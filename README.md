This was a project I used when I wanted to get better with a few different technologies/practices:
<ul>
 <li>Java EE7</li>
 <li>TDD</li>
 <li>Mocking</li>
 <li>Matchers (esp. creating my own custom matchers)</li>
</ul>
<br/>

I have since been distracted by a node/angular project and have not spent much time on it, but hope to get back to it one day. :)

Trello Board found <a href="https://trello.com/b/YCb5FI7J/recipe-project">here</a>.<br/>
Website found <a href="http://www.myrecipeconnection.com/">here</a> (it is really rough and simple still).<br/>
Jenkins builds found <a href="https://jenkins3-recipee7.rhcloud.com/job/jbosswildfly-build/">here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the site goes down... I don't monitor it often so it may stay that way for extended periods (until I want to look up a recipe for dinner).
