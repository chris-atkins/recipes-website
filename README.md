This was a project I used when I wanted to get better with a few different technologies/practices:
 - Java EE7
 - TDD
 - Mocking
 - Matchers (esp. creating my own custom matchers)
 
 I have since been distracted by a node/angular project and have not spent much time on it, but hope to get back to it one day. :)
